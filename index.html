      <h2>My Dearest Fadua,</h2>
      <p>Happy Valentine's Day! I hope this special day finds you surrounded by love and happiness. I wanted to take a moment to tell you how I feel about you, especially on this day dedicated to celebrating love.</p>
	  <p>This day reminds me the first day we met, the 12th September of 2022... EVERYTHING started from the first message I sent you, I was unknowing that this message would change a lot to me in a good way.</p>
      <p>Ever since I met you like 6 months ago, I've been thinking about you constantly. Talking with you has been one of the highlights of my day, and I look forward to every opportunity we have to do talk together.</p>
      <p>I can't help but feel drawn to you, and I know that I have fallen deeply in love with you. I know this may be sudden, but I just had to let you know how I feel. I would be honored if you would acceptto show you just how much you mean to me, on this special day and every day.</p>
      <p>Yours Always,<br>Tristan</p>
